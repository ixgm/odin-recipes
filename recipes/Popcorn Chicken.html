    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Best snack for a movie night!</h3>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups of flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon balck pepper</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>oil for frying</li>
        <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cube</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix flour, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. 
            Beat eggs and lemon juice together in a separate bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 1/2 to 2 inches of oil in a large pot over medium heat. </li>
        <li>Dip the chicken pieces into the flour mixture, then the egg mixture,
             and again into the flour mixture.</li>
        <li>Test the oil to make sure it is hot enough: a small amount of flour dropped in should sizzle. 
            Place 10 pieces of chicken into the hot oil; cook until golden brown, about 8 minutes. 
            Remove from the oil and drain on a paper towel lined plate and season with salt. Repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
    </ol>
